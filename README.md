# my_kirby_game
Making my first platformer game using gamemaker studio 2
To any competent coders: still new to the process so be kind with judgements :)

## Description
You play as a small little creature which looks like kirby but is not (for legal reasons) amd you have two bosses to shoot at: a small enemy and a big boss. It only has a menu, an end screen and 2 levels (more may be added later).

## Inspiration
This is game is made as a gift for someone (I want them to remain anonymous) but also serves as my first attempt at game making.

## Niche details about the game making process 
The game is built on Game Maker Language which has a similar syntax to java script and other C based languages
The sprites are made using GameMaker 2's own sprite editor and GIMP
It helped me learn/improve the following:
- Improved my algorithmic and logical problem solving abilities (several designs might be unorthodox but make the program "work")
- Work with Git and Github for version controlling a project
- How to work with an external input system for dynamic values
- A small look at a software development cycle from gathering, design, implementation and testing to deployment.

## Future improvements
- Refactor the code to be more object oriented such as including a parent enemy type to increase cohesion between different code blocks.
- Optimise gameplay by reducing nested conditionals, using differnt instantiations of similar objects, reducing texture sizes, reducing draw calls and optimise physics with scripting rather than polling.
